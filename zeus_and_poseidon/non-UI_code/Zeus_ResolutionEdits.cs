				// However, the game doesn't allow specifying a size. Only a multiplier can be used.
				// These multipliers are, in turn, used to calculate the size in pixels that the city's viewport should be.
				// I found that Mario's calculations in his guide were off so I've had to redo them.
				//
				// After some trial and error, I found that the formulae the game uses to calculate these are:
				//     Height = (Height_Multiplier - 1) * 15
				//     Width  =  Width_Multiplier  * 60 - 2
				//
				// For the height, the first row of pixels used to draw the city's viewport will be the window's 31st row (the row immediately after the top menu bar).
				// For the width, the first row will be the window's 1st column of pixels (right against the left edge).
				//
				// If either multiplier is too small, the rendered city's viewport will be noticeably smaller, with gaps between
				// this viewport and the UI. Artifacts from previous background images will appear in these gaps.
				// If the width multiplier is too big, the city view will overlap the right side bar.
				// If the height multiplier is too big, the viewport will extend beyond the bottom of the screen.
				//
				// As a result, appropriate multipliers will be ones that come as close as possible to the bottom edge/sidebar without overlapping.
				// To do this, we simply reverse the equations:
				//     Height_Multiplier = Height / 15 + 1
				//     Width_Multiplier  = (Width + 2) / 60
				//
				// When using selected resolution in the calculations, the size of the UI elements need to accounted for:
				//     30px for the top menubar.
				//     182px for the right sidebar. Even though the sidebar's actual width is 186px, the last 4 pixels can be pushed 
				//         off the screen without any problem. Thus, I'll use this fact to get a little bit more space for the city view.
				// 
				// Finally, we also need to round our final figure down to the nearest integer.

				// Due to the nature of how the city view is created using a multiplier, some resolutions where the height is not a multiple of 15 will have
				// a gap at the bottom of the screen where the last background image can be seen. Even the original game with it's vertical resolution
				// of 768px had this problem. To fix this, the game creates a black bar that is drawn over this gap. These two offsets make sure this bar
				// is drawn to the correct length (the window's width). The height appears to be fixed at 9px and I don't know how to change this.
				// That does mean that vertical resolutions which significantly deviate from a multiple of 15 will still have a gap present.
				// 
				// I noticed that Mario's guide recommends modifying the first offset listed here, which appears to check
				// whether the player has set a widescreen resolution (vs. 800x600) but doesn't mention the second offset
				// which makes the black bar get drawn to the length of the resolution's width.

				// This next offset is used to determine which column of pixels in the game's window will be used as the left edge of the right sidebar.
				// The original game uses the calculation "ResolutionWidth - 186" to find this column. However, this causes a problem.
				// The original game used a horizontal resolution of 1024. When used in the formula to calculate a width multiplier (with a sidebar width of 186px),
				// the result is exactly 14, without any decimals.
				//
				// However, the fact that the city view's "camera" uses a multiplier to draw the scene in 60 pixel increments means that
				// just using the original formula to find this number will mean that most resolutions will have a gap
				// between the right edge of the city view and the left edge of the sidebar.
				//
				// To alleviate that problem, my solution is to use the formula mentioned above to calculate the width of the city view using the
				// appropriate multiplier calculated above. This figure is then used to designate where the left edge of the sidebar starts.
				// This means that the sidebar will be shifted left to be next to the city view.

/*
	The above code I wrote was mainly thanks to a post on the Widescreen Gaming Forum written by Mario: https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=172910#p172910
	Inside the zip file he provided, he included a guide for hex-editing Zeus.exe to make changes to the game's "1024x768" resolution option.

	Here are the contents of that guide:
	====================================
	.- Zeus HEX Changes -.
	.-==================-.

	[!] Follow slowly and step by step (modify and run the game to check for changes)
	[!] With these notes and a bit of photoshop every resolution should be doable
	[!] These are based on Jackfuste work
	[!] You need to select 1024x768 resolution in game for this to work
	[!] Resolutions included: 1920x1080 & 2560x1080
	...
	[!] These images need to have the same size as the resolution:

	}

	----[Resolution Width & Height]----

	addr 10ba28: be [ww ww] 00 00 b9 [hh hh]

	----[Fix Opening Screen]----

	addr 1051f8: 81 fe [ww ww] 00 00 75 10
	addr 105210: 81 fb [hh hh] 00 00 75 09

	----[Fix Menu]----

	addr 18ef78: 01 eb 2a 3d [ww ww] 00 00  (fix menu text)
	addr 19ebf8: 74 40 3d [ww ww] 00 00 0f  (fix menu background)
	addr 18e2f0: ff a1 b4 a6 f2 00 3d [ww ww] 00 00  (fix bottom of sidebar cutting)

	----[Main Viewport]----

	addr 11cc18: 27 6a 0a eb 19 3d [ww ww] (render limit)

	[!] You can't have any width or height, you only provide a multiplier (mw, mh)

	> for height: mh = roundUp((hh - 30) * 0.067)
	// example for 1080p: (1080 - 30) * 0.067 = 1050 * 0.067 = 70.35 => 71 for multiplier => 0x47
	// 30 is the height of the top menu
	// 0.067 ~ 1/15 where 15 is the tile height

	> for width: starting_mw = roundUp(ww * 0.017)
	// example for 1920p: 1920 * 0.017 = 32.64 => 33 for multiplier => 0x21
	// 0.017 ~ 1/60 where 60 is the tile width

	[!] This will fill the whole screen over the sidebar and we don't want that.
	But at the same time it gives us a starting value for the width multiplier.
	From here we just lower the value one by one until it looks like the sidebar fits.
	That's why on some resolutions you either cut the sidebar to get fullscreen or don't cut the sidebar and have a small background area to the right.

	// [mh]=[32]; [mw]=[0e] =>  768x1024
	// [mh]=[47]; [mw]=[1d] => 1080x1920
	// [mh]=[5f]; [mw]=[27] => 1440x2560

	[!] After it looks that the sidebar will fit you must measure the viewport width (vw value)(just printscreen and paste it in a photo editor).
	This will give you the sidebar left postion value.

	The game crashes if the viewport is bigger than the resolution. Check that first!!!
